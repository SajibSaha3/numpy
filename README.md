  <h2 id="about">About</h2>
  <p>NumPy is an essential library for scientific computing in Python. This collection of problems covers a wide range of topics, from basic array manipulation to more advanced techniques like boolean indexing, broadcasting, and vectorization. Whether you’re just starting with NumPy or looking to refine your skills, this repository will offer you a structured approach to mastering these concepts.</p>

  <h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
  <p>To begin solving the problems, you’ll need to have Python and NumPy installed on your machine.</p>

  <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Python</strong>: Version 3.6 or higher is recommended.</li>
    <li><strong>NumPy</strong>: Install NumPy by running:
      <pre><code>pip install numpy</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Clone the Repository</strong>:
      <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/yourusername/numpy-problem-solving.git<br>cd numpy-problem-solving</code></pre>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="problems-included">Problems Included</h2>
  <p>Here’s an overview of the types of problems you’ll encounter:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Array Creation and Initialization</strong>: Basics of creating arrays, initializing with specific values, and reshaping.</li>
    <li><strong>Indexing and Slicing</strong>: Techniques for accessing and modifying specific parts of arrays.</li>
    <li><strong>Boolean Indexing</strong>: Applying conditions to filter data in arrays.</li>
    <li><strong>Fancy Indexing</strong>: Advanced indexing techniques to select specific elements.</li>
    <li><strong>Mathematical Operations</strong>: Performing vectorized operations, aggregations, and statistics.</li>
    <li><strong>Broadcasting</strong>: Using broadcasting rules for efficient computations on arrays of different shapes.</li>
    <li><strong>Sorting and Searching</strong>: Techniques for sorting arrays and finding elements.</li>
    <li><strong>Linear Algebra</strong>: Matrix operations, solving equations, and eigenvalue computation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="how-to-use-this-repository">How to Use This Repository</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Problem Files</strong>: Each problem is included as a separate file with instructions and code comments. Simply open the file, read the instructions, and solve the problem by modifying the code.</li>
    <li><strong>Practice</strong>: Try to understand each problem fully before moving on. NumPy has a unique syntax, so it’s beneficial to internalize each concept.</li>
    <li><strong>Solutions</strong>: You can verify your results by running test cases included in the files, or by comparing your output with expected outputs.</li>
  </ol>
